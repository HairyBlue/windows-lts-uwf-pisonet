### Pisonet UWF Setup Script

üìå Overview
This script configures Unified Write Filter (UWF) on Windows to make a Pisonet system work like Deep Freeze.
Every reboot resets the computer to a clean state, while still allowing games and browsers to update normally.

- ‚úÖ Works only on **Windows 10/11 Enterprise LTSC** or **Windows 10/11 Education LTSC**.

üìÇ Exclusions
   The script excludes the following folders so updates are not lost:

   - C:\Games ‚Äì custom game folder

   - C:\Program Files (x86)\Roblox and C:\Users\Public\Roblox ‚Äì Roblox client

   - C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam ‚Äì Steam client

   - C:\Program Files\Epic Games ‚Äì Epic Games launcher

   - C:\Riot Games ‚Äì Riot Games (Valorant, League of Legends)

   - C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome and C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome ‚Äì Chrome updates

   - C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge and C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Edge ‚Äì Edge updates

   - C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox ‚Äì Firefox updates

   - C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution ‚Äì Windows Update files (optional)

‚ö†Ô∏è User data is not excluded. This means all browser history, passwords, Roblox login credentials, and other personal files are wiped at reboot.

üöÄ Usage
For safety I recommend manually do paste the script from: .
```
setup-uwf-pisonet.md
```
OR

Save the script as `setup-uwf-pisonet.ps1.`
Run PowerShell as Administrator.
Execute:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\setup-uwf-pisonet.ps1
```

PC will reboot and UWF will be active.
üîÑ After Reboot
Games update normally.
Browsers update but do not keep customer logins.
Roblox requires login every time.
Any personal changes made by customers are erased automatically.



`Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force` is a PowerShell command that temporarily changes the rules for running scripts.
üîç Parts explained:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy`
This controls what kind of PowerShell scripts are allowed to run on your system. By default, Windows blocks downloaded scripts for safety.

`Bypass`
This tells PowerShell:

‚ÄúIgnore script blocking, run it anyway without warnings.‚Äù
It‚Äôs temporary ‚Äî does not change the permanent settings.

`-Scope Process`
This limits the change to the current PowerShell session only.

Once you close the window, the execution policy goes back to normal.

This avoids permanent security risks.

`-Force`
Skips asking for confirmation (otherwise it would ask ‚ÄúAre you sure?‚Äù).


‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:**  
This script is provided **for testing purposes only**.  
It is intended for **Pisonet use cases** to see how Unified Write Filter (UWF) can help reset PCs after every reboot.  
I am **not an expert** in this field. Use at your own risk ‚Äî misconfiguration may cause apps or Windows updates to stop working properly.  
Do **not** use in production environments without proper IT knowledge.
